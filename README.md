# Model Selection and Model Fit

This repository contains tutorials that explore ways to select phylogenetic models for your data and then analyze how well those models fit the data.

First, we'll use RevBayes to select among substitution models using Bayes factors. The tutorial is available [here](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/model_selection_bayes_factors/bf_subst_model.html) and data files and scripts are available [here](https://github.com/IntroPhylogenomics/ModelSelectionAndFit/blob/master/1_revbayes_model_selection_bayes_factors_bf_subst_model.zip).

We can use Bayes factors to select models in many contexts beyond only substitution models. Here we'll use it to select a partition model. I am supplying you with simulated data for four genes, along with an example Rev script that will estimate the marginal likelihood for one possible partition model. You should modify this script to specify _a different_ partition model, estimate the marignal likelihood, and add your result to the class spreadsheet. You can download the data and scripts [here](https://github.com/IntroPhylogenomics/ModelSelectionAndFit/blob/master/2_partition_model_selection.zip).

The above exercises demonstrate how to measure relative model fit, which asks 'What model, among a set of candidates, fits my data the best?' It is of course possible that all of the models in our set of candidates fit the data poorly. In this case, we would simply be choosing the best of a bad bunch without necessarily realizing it. To avoid this, we often want to measure how well the model describes the data in an absolute sense. These tutorials will show you how to do this using the P<sup>3</sup> pipeline in RevBayes for both [data based](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/model_testing_pps/pps_data.html) and [inference based](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/model_testing_pps/pps_inference.html) test statistics. The relevant scripts and data files for these tutorials are available [here](https://github.com/IntroPhylogenomics/ModelSelectionAndFit/blob/master/3_revbayes_model_testing.zip).
